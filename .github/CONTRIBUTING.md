# Contributing to ANISE

First off, thanks for considering contributing ANISE! :tada::+1:

Your expertise in software development and astrodynamics is invaluable in fostering a vibrant community around this project.

Please adhere to a fundamental rule throughout your contribution: since this is an open-source project accessible to the public, avoid mentioning any customer names in any commit message, unless explicit consent has been granted by the customer.

## Reporting issues

**Encountered a bug in ANISE?** We appreciate your report! Clearly describe the expected outcome versus what ANISE actually produced. Ensuring ANISE is bug-free and thoroughly validated is crucial.

To facilitate bug reproduction and resolution, kindly provide a straightforward example (like a main function with the necessary imports).

## Helping out with development

We welcome all forms of assistance. Remember, ANISE primarily aims to offer key NAIF SPICE functionalities and additional features like trajectory analysis. For comprehensive astrodynamics computations, including mission design and orbit determination, refer to Nyx: <https://github.com/nyx-space/nyx>.
